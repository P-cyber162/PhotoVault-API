🚧 Failed Firebase Project (December 2025)
Overview
This repository contains an early attempt at building a backend project using Firebase and TypeScript. The project was not successful due to over-reliance on AI-generated code without fully understanding the debugging process. As a result, critical issues were left unresolved, and the project could not be completed.

What Went Wrong
Relied soo heavily on AI suggestions without deep comprehension.

Limited debugging practice, which slowed progress when errors appeared.

Sensitive files (e.g., firebase-service-account.json) were mishandled and needed better security practices.

Project structure lacked clarity and maintainability.

Lessons Learned
Understand before you implement: AI can accelerate development, but comprehension is key.

Debugging is a skill: Errors are opportunities to learn, not obstacles to outsource.

Security first: Never commit service account keys or secrets to version control.

Iterative growth: Failed projects are stepping stones toward mastery.

Next Steps
This project will be redone between January 12–18, 2026, with a focus on:

Writing code manually and verifying each step.

Practicing debugging workflows (logs, breakpoints, error tracing).

Using .gitignore properly to protect sensitive files.

Building a cleaner, more maintainable architecture.

Status
❌ Failed (December 2025)  
🔄 Redo planned (January 12–18, 2026)
